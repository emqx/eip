## Motivation

This section should clearly explain why the functionality proposed by this EIP
is necessary. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected
outright.

## Testing Suggestions

The final implementation must include unit test or common test code. If some
more tests such as integration test or benchmarking test that need to be done
manually, list them here.

## Declined Alternatives

Here goes which alternatives were discussed but considered worse than the current.
It's to help people understand how we reached the current state and also to
prevent going through the discussion again when an old alternative is brought
up again in the future.
